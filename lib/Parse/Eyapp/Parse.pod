=head1 NAME
 
Parse::Eyapp::Parse - The parser of Eyapp grammars
 
=head1 Eyapp Grammar 


The parser for the C<Eyapp> language
was written and generated
using C<Parse::Eyapp> and the C<eyapp> compiler (actually
the first version 
was bootstrapped using the L<yapp|Parse::Yapp> compiler).
The Eyapp program parsing the C<Eyapp> language
is in the file C<Parse/Eyapp/Parse.yp> 
in the C<Parse::Eyapp> distribution.
Therefore C<Parse::Eyapp::Parse> 
objects have all the methods in C<Parse::Eyapp::driver>.

A C<Parse::Eyapp::Parse> is nothing but a particular kind of C<Parse::Eyapp>
parser: I<the one that parses> C<Eyapp> I<grammars>.




This section describes the syntax of the Eyapp language using its own notation.
The grammar extends L<yacc> and L<yapp> grammars.
Semicolons have been omitted to save space.
Between C-like comments you can find an (informal) 
explanation of the language 
associated with the token.

The semantic of C<Eyapp> agrees with the semantic of C<yacc> and C<yapp>
for all the common constructions.
