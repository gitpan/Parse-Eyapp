Modification of a read-only value attempted at
/usr/local/perl/510/site/lib/Parse/Eyapp/Driver.pm line 670.

This warning is triggered if the Parse::Eyapp::Driver is executed f.ex.
inside a "for qw(1) {}" loop, which aliases $_ to read-only values. The
culprit line is

   $_ = $right[$i]; # The symbol

which either needs to be changed from using $_ to something else, or $_
needs to be properly localized.

perl v5.10.0
