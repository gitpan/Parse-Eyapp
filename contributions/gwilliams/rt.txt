Using the eyapp frontend, I am unable to create a standalone parser: The generated parser still
uses Parse::Eyapp::Node. I run eyapp using the command:

eyapp -s -m RDF::Query::Parser::SPARQL -o lib/RDF/Query/Parser/SPARQL.pm lib/RDF/Query/
Parser/SPARQL.yp

Is there a way to bundle Parse::Eyapp::Node with the standalone parser, or easily distribute it
with a code bundle?
