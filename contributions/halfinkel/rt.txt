Accessors created using the tree alias feature are not always correct in
the current version. This is because:

1. The $semantic hash reference is not updated upon rule creation to
record non-terminals an semantic.
2. The child index is calculated incorrectly is not all semantic
children are named.

I believe the attached patch fixes both of these issues and adds a test.

Also (not fixed by the attached patch), there should be a way to specify
a prefix for the accessors so that they can work with a tree built with
a specified yyprefix.
