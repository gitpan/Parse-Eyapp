  * ABSTRACT 
  * Edit *.html files and supress error messages
  * output files .pm generated by the tests. Don't
  * beginners tutorial eyappintro.pm
    All the yapp info: How to signal EOF? etc.

  * numchildren method
  * perlidentifiers regexp
  * token definitions %token NUM = qr{\d+}
    It can be used later in the lexer as
           return ('NUM', $1) if m{($NUM)};
    That is the $NUM variable will be declared. Scope?
 
  * bypass and no bypass on an individual base (fine grain bypass)

  ***** Reorganize the translation of Treeregexp: the code in the "and" and =>
    clauses will be a method of the classes of the nodes matching the treeregexp
    - $treereg->classes computes the classes. doing nothing yet
    - @{$methods{$_}} contain the classes
    - Methods Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp::REGEXP_INNER::classes included
    - Factorize

  * star treeregexp will be supressed *
  * "previous" clause for YATW objects when using "bud". The YATW will 
    be executed before visiting the children. An example of the advantage
    of doing this is to use "bud" for scope analysis
  * Jonathan error message
  * %default action must have an scope
  * Factorize YYBuildAST and YYActionforT_TX1X2 etc.
    There is a problem with TERMINAL::save_attributes
    bypass, plus and star lists, etc. There is no coherent interface
    at the moment
  * An action in a %tree directive that returns
    - undef : eliminate the node
    - reference: insert the node
    - string or number: create a TERMINAL node with attr as the string/number
  * tests and reference manual
  * #line directives in treereg
  * Introduce DECLARATION* in treeregexes
  * version numbers
  * dags in types
  * Warning diagnostic (Yure): ID and 'ID' is prone to error
    Non defined variables are considered terminals: see Identifyattr2.yp. Put info in Output
  * Better diagnostics: see -v 
  * Redesign eyapp program structure: head body legs tail or __END__
  * .output in HTML
  * Some data structures inside the Parser object are only required 
    if the %tree or %metatree directives are active. Otimize them away
    when they are not used (for example syntax tokens, bypass, etc.).
  * Change names of _PLUSLIST, etc. Make a directive to name them 
       %name * => _STAR  + => ... , etc.
    It may influence optimizations like the PARENTHESIS one?
  * bypass method for YATW and Node objects

  * test for yyfilename
  * Fix the yyprefix consistency problem between new and YYParse (args)
  * test for warnings in Lalr Simple1.eyp
  * What is YYFilename in Driver.pm

  * Treereg grammar
  * Reference manual. Document functions and methods
    -- Sort by alphabetical order
    -- User methods and subroutines. Internal documentation
    -- Reference manual (perldoc)
    -- Internal methods and subroutines
  * Type analysis and scopes
  * match returning a tree (for scope analysis will be good)

  * Factorize

- Lexical Analysis
  * Specify reserved words, characters, and handlers (like C code) for specific beginnings
  * Lexer automatic construction

- Treereg Tree grammars and tree walkers
 
  * Tests
     - Some rules can be optimized away. Then the name dissapears!!
     - When a token is in uppercase then it does not agree with the string?
     - tests with syntax errors
     - Standalone works?
     - Debug mode works?

  * Uniformize 
     - Lower case in new_grammar, uppercase in Treeregexp new, etc.
     - Also look at scripts

  * Private methods
  * Indentation and line numbers. 

- Translation Schemes
  * Scheme examples: leftrec, etc.
  * Tests
    - In TS delete the code refs using treeregexp
  * Documentation
  * Executable transscheme
  * Delete args in YATW objects it seems they are no use
  * TERMINAL nodes inherit from TS and Node. What if I have two parsers
    in the same application?
  * Put option %yaml file when using a translation scheme to save the AST

  * TS: Don't check syntax during the construction phase?
  * Check syntax option in eyapp
  * Keep Line Numbers in the tree (for tokens)

  * Documentation 
    - Write package with lex and error for Docs
  * Copyrights! Parse::Yapp

  * Factorize lists code
  * Private methods
  * Admitir directivas-especificaciones de si la lista debe ser left-recursive o right-recursive
  * Esquema de nombres de las reglas temporales:
      Reservar la numeración de las reglas de la gramática original
      y usar posiciones adicionales para las reglas temporales.
  * Hacer una directiva para la generacion de reglas de error en listas
  
  * Supress when production code use Data::Dumper;
  
  * %packagename %outputfile %numbers, etc.
  
- Optimizations:
  * Driver in C
  * BuildAST in C


************ PROJECTS *********************
* C interface with YAML
* Human friendly warnings and errors, conflicts, debugger with breaks, etc.
